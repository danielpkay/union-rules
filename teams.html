      <p>Each team starts the match with 15 players on the field and seven or eight substitutes.[47] Players in a team are divided into eight forwards (two more than in rugby league) and seven backs.[48]</p>

      <h2>Forwards</h2>

      <p>The main responsibilities of the forward players are to gain and retain possession of the ball.[49] Players in these positions are generally bigger and stronger and take part in the scrum and line-out.[49] The forwards are often collectively referred to as the 'pack', especially when in the scrum formation.[50]</p>

      <h3>Front row</h3>

      <p>The front row consists of three players: two props (the loosehead prop and the tighthead prop) and the hooker. The role of the two props is to support the hooker during scrums, to provide support for the jumpers during line-outs and to provide strength and power in rucks and mauls. The third position in the front row is the hooker. The hooker is a key position in attacking and defensive play and is responsible for winning the ball in the scrum. Hookers normally throw the ball in at line-outs.[48][51]</p>

      <h3>Second row</h3>

      <p>The second row consists of two locks or lock forwards. Locks are usually the tallest players in the team, and specialize as line-out jumpers.[48] The main role of the lock in line-outs is to make a standing jump, often supported by the other forwards, to either collect the thrown ball or ensure the ball comes down on their side. Locks also have an important role in the scrum, binding directly behind the three front row players and providing forward drive.[48]</p>

      <h3>Back row</h3>

      <p>The back row, not to be confused with ‘Backs’, is the third and final row of the forward positions, they are often referred to as the loose forwards.[50] The three positions in the back row are the two flankers and the number 8. The two flanker positions called the blindside flanker and openside flanker, are the final row in the scrum. They are usually the most mobile forwards in the game. Their main role is to win possession through 'turn overs'.[48] The number 8 packs down between the two locks at the back of the scrum. The role of the number 8 in the scrum is to control the ball after it has been heeled back from the front of the pack and the position provides a link between the forwards and backs during attacking phases.[52]</p>

      <h2>Backs</h2>

      <p>The backs' role is to create and convert point-scoring opportunities. They are generally smaller, faster and more agile than the forwards.[49] Another distinction between the backs and the forwards is that the backs are expected to have superior kicking and ball-handling skills, especially the fly-half, scrum-half, and full-back.[49]</p>

      <h3>Half-backs</h3>

      <p>The half-backs consist of two positions, the scrum-half and the fly-half. The fly-half is crucial to a team's game plan, orchestrating the team's performance.[52] They are usually the first to receive the ball from the scrum-half following a breakdown, lineout, or scrum, and need to be decisive with what actions to take and be effective at communicating with the outside backs.[52] Many fly-halves are also their team's goal kickers. The scrum-half is the link between the forwards and the backs.[52] They receive the ball from the lineout and remove the ball from the back of the scrum, usually passing it to the fly-half.[53] They also feed the scrum and sometimes have to act as a fourth loose forward.[54]</p>

      <h3>Three quarters</h3>

      <p>There are four three quarter positions, the inside centre, outside centre and left and right wings. The centres will attempt to tackle attacking players; whilst in attack, they should employ speed and strength to breach opposition defences.[52] The wings are generally positioned on the outside of the backline. Their primary function is to finish off moves and score tries.[55] Wings are usually the fastest players in the team and are elusive runners who use their speed to avoid tackles.[56]</p>

      <h3>Fullback</h3>

      <p>The fullback normally position themselves several metres behind the back line. They often field opposition kicks and are usually the last line of defence should an opponent break through the back line.[52] Two of the most important attributes of a good fullback are dependable catching skills and a good kicking game.[57]</p>
