      <h2>Scoring</h2>

      <p>Rugby union is played between two teams – the one that scores more points wins the game. Points can be scored in several ways: a try, scored by grounding the ball in the in-goal area (between the goal line and the dead-ball line), is worth 5 points and a subsequent conversion kick scores 2 points; a successful penalty kick or a drop goal each score 3 points.[58] The values of each of these scoring methods have been changed over the years.[59]</p>

      <h2>Playing field</h2>

      <p>The field of play on a rugby pitch is as near as possible to a maximum of 144 metres (157 yd) long by 70 metres (77 yd) wide.[60] In actual gameplay there should be a maximum of 100 metres (109 yd) between the two try-lines, with anywhere between 10 and 22 metres behind each try line to serve as the in-goal area.[60] Several lines cross the field, notably the halfway line and the "twenty-two", which is 22 metres (24 yd) from the goal line.[60]</p>

      <p>Stricter rules apply to the pitch size for matches between national representative teams. The same maximums apply in this case, but the distance between the two try-lines must also be at least 94 metres (103 yd) and the pitch must be at least 68 metres (74 yd) wide.[60]</p>

      <p>Rugby goalposts are H-shaped, and consist of two poles, 5.6 metres (6.1 yd) apart, connected by a horizontal crossbar 3 metres (3.3 yd) above the ground.[60][61]</p>

      <h2>Match structure</h2>

      <p>At the beginning of the game, the captains and the referee toss a coin to decide which team will kick off first. Play then starts with a dropkick, with the players chasing the ball into the opposition's territory, and the other side trying to retrieve the ball and advance it. If the ball does not reach the opponent's 10-metre line the opposing team has two choices: to have the ball kicked off again, or to have a scrum at the centre of the half-way line.[62] If the player with the ball is tackled, frequently a ruck will result.[63]</p>

      <p>Games are divided into 40-minute halves, with a break in the middle.[64] The sides exchange ends of the field after the half-time break.[64] Stoppages for injury or to allow the referee to take disciplinary action do not count as part of the playing time, so that the elapsed time is usually longer than 80 minutes.[64] The referee is responsible for keeping time, even when—as in many professional tournaments—he is assisted by an official time-keeper.[64] If time expires while the ball is in play, the game continues until the ball is "dead", and only then will the referee blow the whistle to signal half-time or full-time; but if the referee awards a penalty or free-kick, the game continues.[64]</p>

      <p>In the knockout stages of rugby competitions, most notably the Rugby World Cup, two extra time periods of 10 minutes periods are played (with an interval of 5 minutes in between) if the game is tied after full-time. If scores are level after 100 minutes then the rules call for 20 minutes of sudden-death extra time to be played. If the sudden-death extra time period results in no scoring a kicking competition is used to determine the winner. However, no match in the history of the Rugby World Cup has ever gone past 100 minutes into a sudden-death extra time period.[65]</p>

      <h2>Passing and kicking</h2>

      <p>Forward passing (throwing the ball ahead to another player) is not allowed; the ball can be passed laterally or backwards.[66] The ball tends to be moved forward in three ways — by kicking, by a player running with it or within a scrum or maul. Only the player with the ball may be tackled or rucked. When a ball is knocked forward by a player with their arms, a "knock-on" is committed, and play is restarted with a scrum.[66]</p>

      <p>Any player may kick the ball forward in an attempt to gain territory. When a player anywhere in the playing area kicks indirectly into touch so that the ball first bounces in the field of play, the throw-in is taken where the ball went into touch.[67] If the player kicks directly into touch (i.e. without bouncing in-field first) from within one's own 22-metre line, the lineout is taken by the opposition where the ball went into touch, but if the ball is kicked into touch directly by a player outside the 22-metre line, the lineout is taken level to where the kick was taken.[67]</p>

      <h2>Breakdowns</h2>

      <p>The aim of the defending side is to stop the player with the ball, either by bringing them to ground (a tackle, which is frequently followed by a ruck) or by contesting for possession with the ball-carrier on their feet (a maul). Such a circumstance is called a breakdown and each is governed by a specific law.</p>

      <h3>Tackling</h3>

      <p>A player may tackle an opposing player who has the ball by holding them while bringing them to ground. Tacklers cannot tackle above the shoulder (the neck and head are out of bounds),[68] and the tackler has to attempt to wrap their arms around the player being tackled to complete the tackle. It is illegal to push, shoulder-charge, or to trip a player using feet or legs, but hands may be used (this being referred to as a tap-tackle or ankle-tap).[69][70] Tacklers may not tackle an opponent who has jumped to catch a ball until the player has landed.[68]</p>

      <h3>Rucking and Mauling</h3>

      <p>Mauls occur after a player with the ball has come into contact with an opponent but the handler remains on his feet; once any combination of at least three players have bound themselves a maul has been set.[50] A ruck is similar to the maul, but in this case the ball has gone to ground with at least three attacking players binding themselves on the ground in an attempt to secure the ball.[50]</p>

      <h2>Set pieces</h2>

      <h3>Lineout</h3>

      <p>Main article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line-out_(rugby_union)"> Line-out (rugby union)</a></p>

      <p>When the ball leaves the side of the field, a line-out is awarded against the team which last touched the ball.[71] Forward players from each team line up a metre apart, perpendicular to the touchline and between 5 m and 15 m from the touchline.[71] The ball is thrown from the touchline down the centre of the lines of forwards by a player (usually the hooker) from the team that did not play the ball into touch.[71] The exception to this is when the ball went out from a penalty, in which case the side who gained the penalty throws the ball in.[71]</p>

      <p>Both sides compete for the ball and players may lift their teammates.[72] A jumping player cannot be tackled until they stand and only shoulder-to-shoulder contact is allowed; deliberate infringement of this law is dangerous play, and results in a penalty kick.[73]</p>

      <h3>Scrum</h3>

      <p>Main article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(rugby_union)"> Scrum (rugby union)</a></p>

      <p>A scrum is a way of restarting the game safely and fairly after a minor infringement.[74] It is awarded when the ball has been knocked or passed forward, if a player takes the ball over his own try line and puts the ball down, when a player is accidentally offside or when the ball is trapped in a ruck or maul with no realistic chance of being retrieved. A team may also opt for a scrum if awarded a penalty.[74]</p>

      <p>A scrum is formed by the eight forwards from each team binding together in three rows.[74] The front row consists of the two props (loosehead and tighthead) either side of the hooker.[74] The second row consists of two locks and the two flankers. Behind the second row is the number 8. This formation is known as the 3–4–1 formation.[75] Once a scrum is formed the scrum-half from the team awarded the feed rolls the ball into the gap between the two front-rows known as the tunnel.[74] The two hookers then compete for possession by hooking the ball backwards with their feet, while each pack tries to push the opposing pack backwards to help gain possession.[74] The side that wins possession transfers the ball to the back of the scrum, where it is picked up either by the number 8 or by the scrum-half.[74]</p>

      <h2>Officials and offences</h2>

      <p>Main articles: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_union_match_officials">Rugby union match officials</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_of_rugby_union">Laws of rugby union</a></p>

      <p>There are three match officials: a referee, and two assistant referees.[76] The latter, formerly known as touch judges, had the primary function of indicating when the ball had gone into "touch"; their role has been expanded and they are now expected to assist the referee in a number of areas, such as watching for foul play and checking offside lines.[76] In addition, for matches in high level competitions, there is often a television match official (TMO; popularly called the "video referee"), to assist with certain decisions, linked up to the referee by radio.[77] The referees have a system of hand signals to indicate their decisions.[78]</p>

      <p>Common offences include tackling above the shoulders, collapsing a scrum, ruck or maul, not releasing the ball when on the ground, or being offside.[79] The non-offending team has a number of options when awarded a penalty: a "tap" kick, when the ball is kicked a very short distance from hand, allowing the kicker to regather the ball and run with it; a punt, when the ball is kicked a long distance from hand, for field position; a place-kick, when the kicker will attempt to score a goal; or a scrum.[79] Players may be sent off (signalled by a red card) or temporarily suspended ("sin-binned") for ten minutes (yellow card) for foul play or repeated infringements, and may not be replaced.[79]</p>

      <p>Occasionally, infringements are not caught by the referee during the match and these may be "cited" by the citing commissioner after the match and have punishments (usually suspension for a number of weeks) imposed on the infringing player.[80]</p>

      <h2>Replacements and substitutions</h2>

      <p>During the match, players may be replaced (for injury) or substituted (for tactical reasons).[47] A player who has been replaced may not rejoin play unless he was temporarily replaced to have bleeding controlled; a player who has been substituted may return temporarily, to replace a player who has a blood injury or has suffered a concussion, or permanently, if he is replacing a front-row forward.[47] In international matches, eight replacements are allowed; in domestic or cross-border tournaments, at the discretion of the responsible national union(s), the number of replacements may be nominated to a maximum of eight, of whom three must be sufficiently trained and experienced to provide cover for the three front row positions.[47][81]</p>

      <p>Prior to 2016, all substitutions, no matter the cause, counted against the limit during a match. In 2016, World Rugby changed the law so that substitutions made to replace a player deemed unable to continue due to foul play by the opposition would no longer count against the match limit. This change was introduced in January of that year in the Southern Hemisphere and June in the Northern Hemisphere.[82]</p>
